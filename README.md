# forecast

## Description

The purpose of this Challenge-6 was to create a 5 Day Weather Forecast Dashboard. In this challenge we were asked to use the API OpenWeatherMap. The biggest issue with this challenge was to find the right API call given that its default form of call required lattitude and longitude in order to provide information. Thanks to this challenge I became more resourceful when looking for the appropriate way to work with an API.
